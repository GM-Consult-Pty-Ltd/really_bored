## **A simple implementation of *The Bored API* .**

This is a simple DART implementation of the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) we built to test our [core dart libraries](https://pub.dev/packages/gmconsult_dart_core). 

It is by no means intended as a full API implementation.

## Overview

The [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) helps you find things to do when you're bored! There are fields like the number of participants, activity type, and more that help you narrow down your results (*unashamedly plagiarized from the Bored Api page on the InterWeb*).

If you don't know what `bored` means (or you are, indeed, bored), check out the [definition of bored](#definitions)!

We provide a few static methods that asynchronously returns an activity from the API based on parameters, or just go for Bored.random.

## Usage

In the `pubspec.yaml` of your flutter project, add the following dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  really_bored: <latest_version>
```

In your code file add the following import:

```dart
import 'package:really_bored/really_bored.dart';
```

Just go for Bored.random.

```dart
  activity = await Bored.random;
```
